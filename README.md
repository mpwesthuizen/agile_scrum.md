# Agile & Scrum: Artifacts, Ceremonies and Roles README

## Scrum
Scrum is a framework of Agile workflow. Scrum is simple. The below scrum artifacts complete the framework and define scrum.

Artifacts in order:

0) sprint planning
1) sprint backlog
2) daily scrum - AKA daily standup
3) sprint review
4) increment

and repeat.

#### Information radiators
To standardise information across the team in scrum, we use information radiators. These are tools used to visualise the process and tasks at hand.

Including:
- Taskboards or Kanban (eg Trello boards)
- Visible charts such as Burn Down, Burn Up and Gantt charts.

#### Definition of Done
This is when all the acceptance criteria is met that makes a product increment releasable.

In product development there are 3 factors to the definition of done

##### 1) Business/functional requirements via EPICS/User Stories:
These are product functionality that is defined in a specific perspective. They will follow the below format;

As a <User|Actor>
I want <What|Act>
So that <Why|Impact>

Simply put the difference between EPIC's and User Stories is that EPIC's are higher level that have more a a wider scope of the product. Whereas the User Stories have a narrow scope relative to the product that typically covers singal functionality/process. Both of these will frquently feature in my Trello boards.

##### 2) Quality requirements: 
These are measures/standards used to ensure quality development. This is usually owned by the development team.
 I will be doing this by utilising my knowledge of technical debt and implementing Test Driven Development via the Unittest library.
 
##### 3) Non functional requirements:
_" Non-Functional Requirements
These are the standard characteristics or attributes of the Product that might not add direct business value but without which your Product can’t move. These quality assurance attributes of the Product can be considered under the quality component too.
Example:_
- _Availability_
- _Maintainability_
- _Performance_
- _Reliability_
- _Scalability_
- _Security_
- _Usability_
- _Compliance/Regulatory
Legal "_ _(Scrum.org)_

#### Sprint Reviews and Sprint Retrospectives
- Reviews between the product owner, scrum team, scrum master and any neccessary management. This meeting  effectively concludes how well the DOD was met as well as any problems that were encountered.

- Retrospectives usually just between the scrum team and scrum master to identify necessary improvements of the sprint.

## Agile
Agile is a set of values that define how to deal with the workflow.

#### The Four Values of Agile
1) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2) Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
3) Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiations
4) Responding to Change Over Following a Plan

## Roles
Who are the people involved with implementing Agile principles with scrum. There are 3 main roles:

- Scrum Master: responsible for ensuring all scrum principles are enforced. They'll help the product owner define value and help the scrum team perform better

- Development Team: responsible for delivering the product. This team is usually comprised of different roles and departments IE. Developers, DevOps, Designers(UI/UX), Testers, etc.

- Product Owner: responsible  for ensuring that the scrum team are delivering the most value defines the acceptance criteria/priority for the development team. 

_Note: These aren't always fixed titles meaning developers, programmers or even other persons can be elected into these roles._
